Password Generator
This project is a web-based password generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create strong and secure passwords based on customizable criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface for quick and efficient password generation.

Working Process
User Input:
Users specify the desired password length and select the criteria for the password, such as whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Character Pool Creation:
Based on the selected options, the tool creates a pool of characters that can be used to generate the password.

Random Character Selection:
Using JavaScript's randomization functions, characters are picked randomly from the pool to form a password of the specified length.

Password Display:
The generated password is displayed on the screen for the user to copy and use.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including the form for user inputs and the display area for the password.
CSS: Styles the interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Implements the core logic for generating the password, handling user interactions, and validating inputs.
Features
Customizable password length (e.g., 8 to 20 characters).
Option to include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Responsive and intuitive interface for ease of use.
Ensures at least one character from each selected category is included in the password.

How to Use
Open the project in your browser.
Select the desired password length and choose the options for the password components.

Future Enhancements
Add a strength meter to indicate the robustness of the generated password.
Include a "Save Password" option to store passwords securely.
Allow users to exclude ambiguous characters (e.g., O and 0, l and 1).

This project demonstrates a practical application of web development and is a helpful tool for improving online security.
